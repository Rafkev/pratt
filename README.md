Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm 

This script contains implementations of the KMP algorithm and the Z algorithm for string matching. You can use the kmp() function to find occurrences of a pattern within a text using the KMP algorithm, and the z_algorithm() function to achieve the same using the Z algorithm. The example usage section demonstrates how to use these functions with a sample text and pattern.
